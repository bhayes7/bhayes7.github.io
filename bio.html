	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<p>Brienne is a writer, programmer, and digital humanist from San Diego, California. They are currently finishing their bachelor’s degree at San Diego State University, where they study English and applied mathematics. In the fall, they will begin their master’s degree in social data science at the University of Oxford.</p>
	<p>A science fiction habitué from an early age, Brienne writes and studies paraliterary works that leverage their marginality to create new modes of discourse. Brienne is particularly invested in how works of science fiction, electronic literature, and experimental literature give queer narratives a place outside of the mainstream. Their writing explores the intersections of science and technology with gender and sexuality and how the resulting confluences and divergences impact the many facets of queer experience.</p>
	<p>You can read a sample of Brienne’s writing <a href="/fiction/serein">here</a> and find their thoughts on some formative texts here.</p>
	<p>Brienne identifies as nonbinary and femme and uses they/them pronouns.</p>
