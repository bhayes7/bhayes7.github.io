	<h1>Bio</h1>
	<p>Brienne is a writer, programmer, and digital humanist from San Diego, California. In the fall, they will begin their master’s degree in social data science at the University of Oxford. They recently completed their bachelor’s degree at San Diego State University, where they studied English and applied mathematics.</p>
	<p>A science fiction habitué from an early age, Brienne writes and studies paraliterary works that leverage their marginality to create new modes of discourse. Brienne is particularly invested in how works of science fiction, electronic literature, and experimental literature give queer narratives a place outside of the mainstream. Their writing explores the intersections of science and technology with gender and sexuality and how the resulting confluences and divergences impact the many facets of queer experience.</p>
