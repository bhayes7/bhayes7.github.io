Some short thoughts on a few books (and non-books) that matter to me.

- *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norell*, Susanna Clarke (2004)

It took Susanna Clarke ten years to write *Jonathan Strange* and nearly a year for me to read it &mdash;
a fact that speaks both to the incredible density of Clarke's novel and its ability to keep me involved 
in its world, no matter the turbulence going on in my own. Worth reading for its impeccable humor and 
its thoughtful takes on magic, history, and intellectual legacy, no matter how long it takes.

- *The Einstein Intersection*, Samuel R. Delany (1967)

Delany's intended title&mdash;*A Fabulous, Formless Darkness*&mdash;is a much more apt description of this book
than what is implied by its bland publication title. This short novels remains one of Delany's greatest 
meditations on myth and queerness in a career defined by its emphasis on myth and queerness. It may take a few
attempts to grasp what's going on, but the magisterial prose in *TEI* will make every one of those readings worthwhile. 

- *Times Square Red, Times Square Blue*, Samuel R. Delany (1999)

On its face, a memoir about a forgotten (or, more accurately, erased) period in the history of New York City; below that face,
a concise, inventive program for a brighter, queer-er urban future. You can read more of my thoughts on this masterpiece
of experimental nonfiction [here](/nonfiction/textual-and-sexual-utopias).

- *GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*, Douglas Hofstadter (1979)

Cognitive scientist and comparative literature scholar (a job title that makes my heart throb) Hofstadter gives us in *GEB* a 
long-form explication of a theory of human consciousness predicated on reflexivity, and, in the process, takes us through countless
whimsical digressions into formal mathematics, genetics, Zen, music theory, and so much else. This is one of those "more than
the sum of its parts" books; each chapter is fascinating and informative on its own, but what's truly incredible about Hofstadter's tome
is the gradual accumulation of those parts into a mind-altering whole. This is a book that has something for everyone because just about
everything is in it.

- *The Dispossessed*, Ursula K. LeGuin (1974)

My favorite novel. A must-read for anyone with academic ambitions, anyone who has ever wondered how we learn and know things, and anyone that has ever thought that we, as a people, can do better.

- *Foldscape*, Porpentine (2015)

Described by the author as a "poem/game made of folders", *Foldscape* gives its readers/players true freedom by taking the interactive
part out of interactive literature. Download it to see what I mean&mdash;what at first appears to be frustratingly simple soon
blossoms into something truly transformative, if your brain can handle it.

- *All Systems Red*, Martha Wells (2017)

This novella sticks with you in a way that a simple story about a snarky cyborg absolutely shouldn't. The substance here isn't
the compelling but somewhat-standard sci-fi action plot, but the character of Murderbot, whose narration provides us with one of the most
intricate and entertaining depictions of building one's identity every put to the page. I believe that trans* people and anyone who has
ever experienced social anxiety will sympathize with the moody Murderbot, who would rather sink into the safety of its favorite TV shows
than interact with people. But *All Systems Red* (and *The Murderbot Diaries* generally) give us a brilliant glimpse into the process 
of building a sense of self while stuck in the cultural margins.
