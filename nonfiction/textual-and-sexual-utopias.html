    <h2>Abstract</h2>
	<p>
        Samuel R. Delany’s essay <i>Times Square Red, Times Square Blue</i> advances a model for an urban utopia adapted from an unexpected setting: the pornographic movie theaters, frequented primarily by gay men, that once populated New York City’s Times Square. 
        In making an argument for the expansion of public spaces that replicate the theaters’ ability to facilitate friendly and productive contact between members of disparate cultural and economic groups, Delany must overcome majoritarian objections to the roles of sexuality and inter-class contact in defining the urban environment.
        Delany simultaneously counteracts these objections and practices the principles he promotes through the subversive uses of paratextual elements entwined with his argument: the essay’s bipartite structure, its expansion of the roles of subjugated textual spaces like footnotes and parenthesis, and the collinear organization of the essay’s second half all allow Delany to demonstrate the renovation of discourse that undergirds inter-class contact.
        These elements help to transform <i>Times Square Red, Times Square Blue</i> into a textual utopia that demonstrates the immediacy of Delany’s queer urban utopia.
