<p>	The rain had a touch so gentle that Laura could only know it was there by moving through it. The droplets were diminutive but pervasive, as though the atmosphere had adopted a character of its own and decided to more firmly announce its presence. It had been years since she’d felt discomfort from the odd plasticity of her waterproofed clothes, designed and woven by machine-hand to last her stay in this place where the rain never stopped while also never seeming to properly start. The synthetic stuff, alien to this planet, kept the rain from her body, but above the tight collar of her work shirt she let the invisible droplets settle where they may on her face and in her cropped-short hair. Wetting without dampening, the perpetual rain of Petrichor made an ever-present chaperone on her extended field trip.</p>
<p>She reached up and plucked a piece of fruit from one of the willowy-white trees, a skeleton of an organism. It looked as though it could collapse underneath the weight of the condensation amassing on its branches, but the branch snapped back to its former place with attentive grace once Laura had unburdened it of its fruit. She had come to call the round red fruits apples, though their skin was downy like a fig and they housed a single, massive, marble-like seed. Laura bit into the fruit and the flesh gave way with none of the crisp resistance she would expect from an Earth-apple; it melted away on her tongue and she swallowed without chewing. The taste was close to that of an Earth-apple, but perhaps Laura only thought that from nostalgia, or from some limitation of her tongue, so accustomed to the fruit of the Earth. From a nearby tree, a turgid, parturient fruit fell and burst against the soil. From the split seed swarmed dozens of flower-pods, folding and flapping their petals like moths until they came to settle amongst the grass, where they would deposit their seeds. Laura dodged away from the flower-swarm, nearly choking on fruit flesh as she brushed seedlings from her shirt.</p>
<p>Ahead of her the thick grass abruptly gave way to a view of a lake, maybe a hundred meters below, its surface in minor chaos from the impact of the rain, each propagating ripple reflecting the rays of Petrichor’s star. Though never as bright as her familiar Sol, looking at Petrichor’s star struck Laura with nostalgia for the sun that had once sizzled her skin while she scrambled across the sage-choked sandstone of California, where she and her father had trekked again and again, decades ago. The light and the motion lent the lake the likeness of a kilometer-wide diamond deposit only just unearthed and polished clean after epochs spent below Petrichor’s soil.</p>
<p>For all Laura knew, this lake <i>was</i> that new; Petrichor’s lakes were transient beings, finding impromptu homes in basins between the planet’s hills before migrating without apparent cause or pattern. Someday, perhaps in a year, this lake would drain and leave behind it a grassy valley, soggy but otherwise undisturbed by its aquatic visitor. When that happened, one could walk to what was now the lake’s deepest point to find a bed of squat white flowers. These would spread across the former lakebed, their stems growing bulbous, waiting for the lake to return so they could burst and release thousands of translucent seedlings that would wriggle like tadpoles through Petrichor’s transitory waters.</p>
<p>It would take a few hours to find a way down the cliff, but Laura wanted to see the newborn lake up close. She knew she would learn nothing from it. She had seen dozens of lakes bloom and vanish in her twenty-four years on Petrichor, and just as many spontaneous rivers that had knotted together, diverged, and swerved along new paths in the course of weeks. What she wanted from Petrichor couldn’t be found in its incidental bodies of water, where each new lake could simply be the chaotic antecedent of a geographic shift halfway across the plant. She was looking for the things that she knew Petrichor <i>wanted</i> her to see.</p> 
<p>Three years into her expedition, Laura had been hiking along a plateau when she’d been surprised by a sudden gush of water from an unassuming patch of rock. Rather than shoot into the air to join the planet’s unending showers, the droplets were summarily yanked from their flight and forced to crawl along the stone, forming an immense pattern of concentric semicircles bridged by strips of pooled water that branched into semicircles of their own, circling and branching again and again until the spout ceased. She had climbed a tree at the edge of the outcropping so she could get clearer pictures. Something about the pattern had felt so purposeful that, distracted in deciphering it, Laura had nearly fallen from her branch. It was not until some weeks later when, idly scrolling through her photos while attempting a taxonomy of Petrichor’s river grasses, it struck her that the circular pattern, unrolled, was identical to her own diagram. With this realization, the orbit of her thoughts began to circle more and more tightly around the idea she thought she’d left behind at home: the Will of the Earth.</p>
<p>It was something her father would mutter, among other, darker things, under his breath whenever their breakfasts were interrupted by reports of new wildfires, of more people taking to the highways when another reservoir dried up and displaced them from their towns. It had taken her until she was ten to work up the courage to ask him about it. He had paused the newscast on his phone, leaned back in his chair, and spent a while thinking before he spoke. In the interim, their shorthair had meandered by and leapt up into his lap.</p>
<p>“A lot of people think that the Earth is just this big, dumb rock floating around in space. But it’s so much more than that, Laura. It’s a mind of its own, bigger than all of ours. Think about it&mdash;you, me, Rico&mdash;” he ran a hand down the cat’s appreciatively arched back&mdash; “we’re all a part of the Earth, as is every forest, every lawn, every river delta. It’s so big, and so brilliant, and we can’t fully understand it, because we’re a part of it. But it thinks, and it acts in ways that we usually just can’t see. That’s the Will of the Earth.”</p>
<p>Later that year, her father had taken her hiking along the seaside cliffs of northern San Diego while he was attending a conference on water conservation policy. He had told her how he, too, had hiked there as a child, when the landscape could still break out in rich, vibrant green, when the last of the Ponderosa pines still stood. But when Laura had looked about her, she had seen nothing but dry, yellowy grasses, thriving off of nitrogen deposits left in the soil by traffic on the nearby highway. They had followed a loop trail that encircled a mound of dirt along the cliff’s edge, and while she had marveled at the ocean and the haze above it, he had gone to the dirt, and Laura had heard him choke back a few sobs before they continued. Only years later did she realize that he had been envisioning the trees that had vanished in what, to the Earth, amounted to mere moments.</p>
<p>He would have loved Petrichor, and Laura resented that he had died mere months before she had left for it. She doubted he would have lived long enough to receive the first of the pictures from her expedition, even without the complications at the end. But she knew that seeing Petrichor would have brought him some solace. He was a man who would cry over trees, and here, only here, he could have seen a tree, over the course of hours, disentangle its roots from the ground, meander a few meters away, and settle back down again. Here, he could have seen the Will of Earth enacted on a time scale compressed enough to make it obvious to the human observer, even if the motivation behind that will remained obscured. <i>Maybe Dad would have known how to read the signs</i>, she thought. He had believed without evidence and had died unfulfilled. She had not believed until Petrichor had spoken to her. But it would not be enough until she could decipher its language.</p>
<p>Laura stepped over a jutting rock and saw that the shelf of stone sloped down the side of the cliff, terminating only a few meters above the cascading grass below. Her luck brought her a wry smile as a flash of bitterness overtook her—why did Petrichor give her this, when it has refused so much else. The climb shifted into a hike. She went slowly, knowing that she would likely not make it back to the mobile lab before nightfall, and not caring. Only two weeks until she left for home, her quarter-of-a-century grant that had once promised eternity now coming to its end. And, by some definitions, her research had been successful. She had proposed to study Petrichor’s water systems and divine from them how the planet’s geography could relocate bodies of water without applying excessive energy. If successful, she had argued, environmental engineers could replicate the effect on Earth, redistributing water to the most drought-choked regions with minimal resource expenditure. Seven years into her research, though, she had found that her premise was entirely backwards.</p>
<p>Any time the perennial showers intensified, Laura would sit in a meadow and watch as rain would slide along tall pieces of grass, sloping down and back up again like ramps, and the droplets launch back into the sky. She liked to trace their descent and ascent, to focus solely on the droplets returning to the air, as though the rain were falling in reverse. One day, she had watched a plump droplet splatter against the underside of a broad leaf and, with sudden inspiration, leapt up and pulled a leaf from the tree. In the leaf’s vasculature, she could see the veins twist and reshape themselves in fractaline spirals, refusing to settle into a single formation. And she knew then that it was the water itself, independent of geography, that was alive. </p>
<p>Chemical tests confirmed this, though only indirectly. Nothing about the water <i>looked</i> different on the level of an individual molecule—it was just good old dihydrogen monoxide, bonded with its signature, spectacular kink. But wherever water amassed, so, too, did its unexpected metamolecular properties. The water interacted with itself, and with other matter on Petrichor, in a way that it simply wasn’t supposed to. The planet’s geography had adapted to interface with its aberrant water population: certain strata of rock attracted it while others repulsed it; the ubiquitous grass was a neutral barrier that the water could not cling to, though it could be bypassed with little resistance.</p>
<p>“Our chemistry just can’t explain it,” she had stammered, dictating to her phone and unable to keep still. “The matter is different, at the atomic or the subatomic level, maybe, I don’t know, I just don’t have the tools here to find out, and I'm just an environmental engineer, not a particle physicist, god dammit…”</p>
<p>This was two years ago. She had samples, of course, and maybe someone could use them to transfigure Earth’s own water into Petrichor’s&mdash;and then, maybe, they could produce the self-replicating reservoirs, the relocatable lakes, the adaptable rivers she had espoused in her grant proposal. But she knew that, even in that unlikely reality where Petrichor’s water revealed itself to terrestrial physics, transforming all of Earth’s water would be a task akin to alchemy, to magic. And even then, would it do what they wanted it to?</p>
<p>The water was, after all, not the secret. Only Petrichor knew the secret, and it wanted to tell her. But she lacked the tools to listen.</p>
<p>Reaching the terminus of the stone shelf, she scaled the last few meters of cliff before letting herself fall back-first into the grass’s embrace. She couldn’t help but feel tired, and she considered just remaining there for the rest of the day, or the night, or a few weeks. But she had to acknowledge that she was only slacking off on her exit preparations. She knew that once the lab had been tidied up and she had returned to the ship awaiting her in Petrichor’s orbit, she had nothing to look forward to but too many lonely, timeless days, arranging thousands upon thousands of photographs of bodies of water that would have ceased to exist by the time they’d landed, picking the best words to explain how Petrichor, bluer than the blue planet, could not save them.</p>
<p>As she had grown older, she had dismissed the Will of the Earth as an unfortunate confluence of her father’s belief in his work and the spiritualism of his parents, both members of the new hippie movement that had appeared after the Transpacific War had started and the aridity had gotten really, really bad. She had dismissed it all the way through her Ph.D. thesis on interactions between disjoint water networks, through two decades of research that, she now understood, she’d hoped would show there was not, and never could be, a Will of the Earth. She’d gone on dismissing it right up until Petrichor had written to her with its diagram of water on rock. And with the above-ground root structures in the shapes of Platonic solids she found wherever she planned on parking the mobile lab. And with the sweeping, daunting, letter-like patterns she saw painted along every cliff face, which she could never seem to get far enough away from for the message in its entirety to snap into view&mdash;and if she could, she was not sure she would be able to read what Petrichor had written for her. </p>
<p>She unpeeled herself from the grass and set off, finally, towards the lake. In her head, she began dictating a letter to her father, one of thousands that had never seen paper: <i>Dear Dad. I used to think that you were completely nuts. I thought that maybe all of that Will of the Earth stuff was just to keep you going when every day it seemed more and more hopeless, but really, I knew you meant it. The Earth thinks, and you know what it must think? It must think we’re such a terrible nuisance, trying so hard to get its attention, to tell it what to do, that it’s decided to get rid of us. So what do we do? We ask it for more. And it hears us, and it can’t understand us. And it’s nothing for it to get rid of us. In a blink, we’re all gone. You said we should listen to the Earth. Above all else, listen. But I think maybe we just can’t understand. Here I’ve been, for twenty-five years, and I can see it right in front of me that Petrichor has something to say, and I listen, and all I hear is nonsense. I want something from it and it wants something from me and neither of us gets anything. There was no answer at home, Dad, there’s no answer here, there’s-</i> and she stopped, realizing that she had crossed beneath the shadow of a stone pillar twice her height.</p>
<p>A strange rustle from beneath her. A tendril of water had shot out from the lake and, compelled along by the grass that refused it purchase, was slipping towards the pillar. Minutes passed and the water, a drunk snake, sloshed around in the grass in every direction and yet, somehow, inevitably towards the pillar. Whatever velocity it had was nearly exhausted as it approached the pillar, and when it seemed as though it must come to a halt, the tendril’s tip touched the pillar, and the pillar came to life. The water spiraled around and up the pillar so quickly that Laura thought she could feel heat coming off it. When water reached the pillar’s apex, it gathered into a sphere whose circumference was growing greater and greater with each passing second. The trickle of water from the lake that had begun this cataclysm grew to a torrent; Laura could see that soon, the sphere would gather up the entire lake, and whatever other water to which the lake was connected.</p>
<p>She went for her camera, only to remember that she had ceased to carry it with her months ago. Then, she turned and ran. </p>
<p>She sprinted to the edge of the valley and started up a grassy slope, running for what felt like hours, and Laura could not help herself from whipping her head around to see how close the rising tide was behind her. Whenever she began to slow, the thought of water licking at her heels hurried her along. Eventually, as drenched with sweat within her shirt as she was with rain outside it, she crested the edge of another cliff and clambered up a tree. She watched as the water level raised another foot to meet the precipice, then just as suddenly as it had begun, it stopped. Laura slid down from the tree and collapsed into the grass, wheezing. She dragged herself to the cliff’s edge. Where, earlier that day, there had been a valley extending out to the horizon, there was now an ocean. </p>
<p>Laura began to hiccup with laughter. Just like that, an ocean, and all fresh water, too. She got to her feet and screamed until what little air remained in her lungs was exhausted. The valley would have carried it, and maybe, amplified over that distance, Petrichor would have heard it. But the ocean, with its new tides just testing their rhythms, swallowed it up.</p>
<p>She tramped home in the dusk. On the way she stopped to allow dozens of trees to rush past her, no doubt responding to today’s tremendous ecological disturbance. She thought of her father, bedridden, unable to speak. She had promised to finish his work. She had pleaded with his dying eyes, perhaps asking for assurance he could not give, that on Petrichor, or, if not Petrichor, somewhere else, there would be a way to fix it all. He died thinking himself a failure, though he had insisted otherwise in his last days. He had wanted to bring order to a world that had set itself on fire. He had no way of knowing that the world took no part in it. We had set ourselves on fire, and the world was merely there to watch.</p>
<p>Coming upon the clearing where the mobile lab waited, Laura snatched at a low-hanging fruit, a bulbous, conical thing like a bunch of intergrown bright-red grapes. She squeezed the fruit with one hand and threw it to the soil. It caught aflame and burned, slow and controlled, gradually scorching a burrow into the ground for the seed within to nestle. The flame persisted for an hour, and Laura waited for the last embers to die before going inside and collapsing into her berth.</p>
<p>In the night, a lake that had been resting a few kilometers away got up and rolled to the lab’s doorstep. </p>
